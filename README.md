# Popular Category Theory Blog

This blog's aim is to introduce Category Theory from scratch, and make it a subject that is accessible to anyone, regardless of their mathematical background. I try to make little to no assumptions about the reader's knowledge, and use real-world examples to appeal to intuition. There are no prerequisites, but these posts build atop each other (i.e. the previous post would be a prerequisite for the next).

Another aim is for me to keep track of what I am learning, and check if I actually understand it. I personally believe that I can't claim to have understood something if I can't explain it to a fifth-grader in conceivable form.
