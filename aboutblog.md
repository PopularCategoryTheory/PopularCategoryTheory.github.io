# üëã Introduction

Hello there!

My name is Khyathi, and I'm a seventeen-year-old from India who aspires to be a pure mathematician some day! When I'm free, I enjoy browsing random Wikipedia Pages, solving puzzles, reading articles on philosophy and aviation, and listening to music.

When it comes to math, I'm currently interested in studying Algebraic Structures, Number Theory, Mathematical Philosophy, and most importantly: Category Theory, which is why I decided to start this blog.

# ‚ùì Why Category Theory?

It is my personal belief that Category Theory is a severely underrated way of encoding mathematics as we know it today. 

Why?

In order to answer that, we must ask ourselves another question:

## What do we, as human beings do, when we need to solve a problem?

Imagine you are nearing your first birthday. For months, you have been trying to take steps: trying hard to mimic the adults around you, who have been doing something that is foreign to you: walking.

You try very hard to mimic them, you keep making "baby steps" (quite literally), and failing repeatedly. However, one day, you start walking.

Years later, you don't need help walking. You know exactly how to. The information that you used to learn how to walk helps you solve similar "problems" such as learning how to run.

In any general case: human beings try to use their past experience in order to solve problems. If they don't have this past experience, they subconsciously try to mimic successful attempts of said problem by others.

Imagine one day, you wake up, and have this knowledge, but don't know how to make connections (the ability to retrieve past knowledge), or these connections don't come as quickly as you want them to. So if I told you to walk, you wouldn't be able to recognize "walking", although you actually know how to walk!

To a mathematician, the inability to make connections and see things in different perspectives will lead to lack of insighfulness.

Category Theory promotes structural thinking, which helps us make these connections easier. It's not just important from a mathematical perspective, but also from a philosophical one. We need to bring the concept of Category Theory to the masses: since this way of looking at things is life changing.

# ü§î Why Should I Care? I Don't Like Math.

That's a great question, and definitely one worth asking. 

Here's the thing: Category Theory is not just a way to do math. It's a way to think. 

I recently read this [post,](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fW9n8bEuMpLwkxCx6/introduction-to-introduction-to-category-theory) which talks about the relationship between Category Theory and Rationality. What is "Rationality" in the first place? It's simply the act of thinking based on reason and logic. Doesn't this relate to our example on walking?

One of the outcomes of [perspectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspectivism) is that our knowledge of a certain object is bound by the perspectives of the people who have witnessed said object. The word "bound" bothers me - this means there is already a limit to our knowledge, which I don't like. However, our knowledge would be far more limited if we weren't able to relate back to things, and lost our perspectives. In fact if every human being was "impaired" enough to not be able to make observations based on individual experiences, we would know about nothing.

Category Theory can change that, since it's all about being able to make connections between structures. If you want to read a formalization of this in Applied Category Theory, [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.1694.pdf) is quite interesting.

# üîÅ What Can I Learn From This Blog?

There is just one thing you need in order to understand the posts in this blog: keep an open mind, while truly believing in the power of categorical reasoning. 

The posts also build up on top of each other: so you need to read Post 1 in order to read Post 2, and so on and so forth. 

The aim of this blog is to introduce three viewpoints to Category Theory: 

1. A Philosopher's View of Category Theory,
2. A Pure Mathematician's View of Category Theory, and
3. Applied Category Theory, especially it's applications in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Science.

(The above are just viewpoints I currently have knowledge of, I will add more once I learn more!)

Maintaining this blog also gives me an opportunity to keep track of my own knowledge, and simplifying it in such a way that I can retrieve it in case I ever forget.
